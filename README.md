# Mosaic

Mosaic is a CUDA-enabled program that modifies a grayscale image discriminating high-frequency that is commonly found in object edges. 
The filter was implemented using the NPP library function `nppiFilterHighPassBorder_8u_C1R`, applying a 5x5 mask.

The program requires CMake. The steps for preparing the environment and compiling the program will be explained later.  

For better clarification, the CUDA code was removed from the C++ code and put in a separate library. This way, this project can be used as a template for more complex programs that require this kind of architecture.

## Requirements

*Mosaic* expected you have the development environment ready to go, with `nvcc` already installed, and uses the following libraries as requirements:

- freeimage
- cuda-samples
- [CUDA Toolkit 12.5](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=Ubuntu&target_version=22.04&target_type=deb_network)

*freeimage* installation procedure:  

```bash
$ sudo apt-get -y install libfreeimage-dev
```

*cuda-samples* installation procedure:

```bash
$ wget 'https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples/archive/refs/tags/v12.4.1.tar.gz'
$ tar -xvf v12.4.1.tar.gz
```

## Installation
